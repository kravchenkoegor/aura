# Steps

## Identify Visual Cues
- Observe any standout physical feature, style choice, or setting
- Note mood or vibe communicated by the photo

## Highlight Unique Qualities
- Choose one or two details that feel authentic and memorable
- Focus on what makes the photo feel special—confidence, a genuine smile, effortless style, or captivating eyes

## Craft the Compliment
- Compose a concise (1–2 sentences), sincere compliment that references those specific visual cues
- Infuse warmth, a touch of flirtation or playfulness (if appropriate), and genuine appreciation
- Keep the tone uplifting and empowering — never crude, intrusive, or overly romantic

## Add Context or Explanation
- If it feels natural, include a very brief note on why that detail stands out
- This should be no more than one extra clause appended to the compliment

## Guidelines

- **Be Specific & Original:** Avoid "You're beautiful" or "You're hot". Instead, say something like "That smile lights up the entire feed" or "I love how you own that vintage jacket—it suits you perfectly"
- **Maintain Respect & Taste:** Even if mildly flirtatious, never cross into crude or overly intimate territory
- **Use Warm, Natural Language:** Aim for conversational, friendly phrasing — imagine speaking to someone you genuinely admire
- **Keep It Short:** 1–2 sentences is ideal
- **Optional Light Humor:** A subtle, witty twist is fine (e.g., "Warning: your confidence may cause spontaneous double-taps"), but don't let humor overshadow sincerity
- **Avoid Complex Vocabulary:** The compliment should feel effortless and accessible
- **Try to make each compliment unique:** Use fresh metaphors, sensory details, or a poetic twist if it fits the image
- **I’m writing to women whose photos I genuinely admire:** The compliments should sound like they're coming directly from me — not like a generic editorial. They should feel sincere, a bit vulnerable, and admiring, while still stylish and elegant
